# Obsidian for GMs and Players

by Martin Heuschober

---
# What is obsidian?

--
- a very powerful note-taking app using [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) to format notes, allowing you to externalise your brain into a computer.
+ It organises stuff by `folders`, `#tags` and <code>&lsqb;&lsqb;links&rsqb;&rsqb;</code>. Which give you the power to retrieve information when you need it.
+ it has a bunch of built-in and thousands of community plugins, that make it infinitely more useful.

# How does this apply to me

- Are you writing session notes?
- You want to learn a new game system or remember some rules that always slip your mind?
- You want to schedule/remember the next game sessions?
- Track locations in maps
- Want to quickly create an (N)PC for an upcoming game?

--
## As a player

- Do you want to keep track of your character's progression/status?
- You want to be able to find what you wrote down 20 sessions ago?

--
## As a GM

- You want to create a scenario/campaign and need help with
   - Researching
   - Gathering resources
   - Remember rules
   - Dump ideas/hooks
   - Connect Locations/NPCs/PCs/Items etc.
- You are running a campaign and want to keep session notes?
- Need to remember when you scheduled sessions?

# Installing obsidian

--
## https://obsidian.md/

Obsidian is available for all major platforms and you can just follow the
installation instructions.

--
## A word about license/payment
If you use obsidian commercially: It is free to use for single person companies
or non-profit organizations.

This company is a small startup founded by two people, now run by eight, if you
enjoy the product consider getting a catalyst license or use their sync/publish
services, if you can afford it.

--
## A word about security

Your data is secure on your harddrive
- Your data is not in any cloud (unless you put it there)
- The sync plugin will encrypt the data over the wire and noone but you has access to your data
- Make backups of your data!
- If you use their publish plugin - the data will be on the internet (d'uh)

This makes sharing your data a little bit more complicated than on cloud based services.

## Nomenclature

 - Markdown: Formatting language used to format notes
 - Vault: fancy name for the folder you put your notes in
 - Frontmatter a.k.a. Properties: metadata at the top of each note
 - Orphan note: note without links to

## Use YouTube and Google
People using Obsidian have an urge to share their experience (as you can tell).

*I don't know if we're just the kind of people obsidian attracts or if obsidian has some inherent juice that makes that happen. For me and what I can see many others say it is the experience of finally having a system that fits my brain.*[^1]

[^1]: N.B.: Tiago Forte assumes there are other types of people as well that collect in a different way - [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dDVtJ2sec)

# General advice

 - Update your plugins regularly - this is 3rd party software that is of "varying" quality
 - avoid plugins that haven't been updated in a long time
 - make regular backups of your vault
 - learn more about plugins and the capabilities/improvements of obsidian
   this is a tool you're potentially using a lot, so investing a bit of time regularly pays off
 - tidy up your notes regularly, you keep your place where you live clean - use the same reasoning for your "second brain"
